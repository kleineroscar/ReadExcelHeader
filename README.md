# ReadExcelHeader

This Pentaho Data-Integration (PDI) step provides you with the column names and types from an excel file.
This fixes the problem of not knowing the structure of an excel file before reading/having to validate the structure.
We can use this information in combination with a Metadata Injection (MDI) step and dynamically read an excel file, regardless of it's structure.

Tested in PDI 9.0
